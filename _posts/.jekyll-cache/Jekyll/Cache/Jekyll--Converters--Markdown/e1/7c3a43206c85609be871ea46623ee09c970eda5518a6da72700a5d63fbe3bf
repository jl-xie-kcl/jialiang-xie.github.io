<h2 id="taxonomies">Taxonomies</h2>

<p>The collections on gulag.online are divided into four main categories: People, Places, Items, Articles. Under each category, collections can be searched through different tags.</p>

<p>However, there is a drawback that search function is not embedded inside gulag.online, which means users have to look for collections by order, or search it through tags. Both of them are not flexible as typing in a search column.</p>

<h2 id="about-the-team-of-gulagonline">About the Team of Gulag.online</h2>

<p>According to the information at the bottom of homepage, Gulag.online is a project of Gulag.cz. No more information was mentioned in the online museum, but in its parent organization gulag.cz.</p>

<p>Its team, Gulag.cz Association, based in Czech Republic, is an organization (research institute or NGO?) focusing on the Gulag prison system established in 2009. the Association is co-funded by Erasmus+ Programme of EU. The website showed seven main members of the team, and eight were mentioned in its annual report. The organization accepts donation online. Therefore, the evidence above imply that this online museum is made by a small or middle size team (seven to eight main members, probably with other members or volunteers that were not mentioned) that runs not for profit.</p>
