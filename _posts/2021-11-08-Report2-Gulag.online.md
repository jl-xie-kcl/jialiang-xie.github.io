## Overall User Experience

Generally, the user experience of Gulag.online on both computer and smartphone are not bad. To be more specific, the user experience when visiting it on computer is much better than doing on smartphone. The main reason is that using smartphone to look at locations related to the subject of the article is more inconvenient.

When visiting the website on computer, the map will change and show the reader the related locations and tracks automatically as the reader scrolls to certain paragraph, which leaves the reader a deeper impression about the experience in Gulag camps.

However, sometimes it seems a little too sensitive and annoying that the map changes quickly when the reader scrolls, because the reader may not scroll it intentionally, or he/she is reading the same paragraph when scrolling.

When visiting it on smartphone, as the map is not showed automatically, the user cannot experience the main feature of the website, though the reader can focus on the article in this way.
